eF Drift Car Scrutineer â€” Beta Preview 0.1.0
============================================

Highlights
----------
- Enforces the new EFDC prefix requirement for submitted car folders, blocking inspections for incorrectly named entries and surfacing the status in generated reports.

Notes
-----
- This is the first beta drop. Expect follow-up builds to expand on additional competition checks and quality-of-life improvements.
- Reference data and tooling remain identical to the latest alpha; regenerate payload assets before packaging a release.
